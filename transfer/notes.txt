action transfer learning


policy transfer learning


replay transfer 


noise from other network



inter agent transfer learning

shouldnt learn better but faster

policy transfer, critic transfer, buffer transfer, reward shaping


sample other policies for exploration for critic to learn

policy learns from multiple critics


other:

might could would = bad
first paragraph = what paper is about
specific application - dont be vague
agents have ____ - give example
avoid human comparison


1- intro first paragraph:
define problem
what is it
why important

2- define difficulty (related work)
-general difficulty, how addressed, second more specific difficulty

3 - "in this paper..." what you are going to do / what are you pitching (approach)
"the key contribution/ idea"

4 - how does solution solve difficulty?
" what is cool about this "

5 - what is the impact/ results / contributions / results (results) (can use page six terms)
speedups? performance? what leads into?

expand into paper
shrink into abstract

that used for differentiat
,which , for additional info

advice

dont: start scentence with "there are"
"can be" too wishy washy - does is better
avoid filler like "very, extreme"
repetition is worse than clarity
	except math to intuition
"propose" is not direct enough "what you did" better
dont use vague wording
